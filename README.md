Project for Neural Networks class




Market movement estimation using neural network

Summary:

  On this project we will be trying to predict stock market’s price using LSTM neural network. Predicting a stock market price is a great challenge due to its immense complexity and chaotic and dynamic environment. We have decided on applying machine learning algorithms on historical data to predict future prices, specifically the long short-term memory neural network. We will focus on 1 specific stock and its price and train our model on it. We will try to get a prediction that has a better predicting ability for price going up or down than random choices. We will test the model prediction on real-time stock data to validate its prediction capability.



Task breakdown:

-Reading studies related to the project
-Choosing a specific stock
-Data extraction
-Analysis and choosing network’s architecture
-Training the network
-Testing and modification
-Finalization and result analysis
-Presentation of the finished project



Project results and deliverables:

  The end product is a neural network that predicts whether the price will go up or down on the next time period that is specified (1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour etc...). It should be better than random guessing, that is its accuracy should be greater than 50%. The bigger the accuracy of prediction the better. We will also test its profitability with what would have happened with a starting investment if we had bought/sold as the network predicted. Market transaction fees and other factors should be considered when calculating profitability.
